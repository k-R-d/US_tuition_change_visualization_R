# Average US Tuition changes visualized in R

This is a visual exploration of the 'us_avg_tuition' dataset included in the #tidytuesday visualization challenges 
tidytuesday promotes the use of R's tidyverse packages in exploring and visualzing data

Here I explore the change and growth in the average tuition costs from 2004-05 to 2015-16 by US states

Code is in R
